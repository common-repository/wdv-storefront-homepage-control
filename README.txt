This plugin allows Woocommerce Storefront Theme users to control display of selected blocks and categories on default Storefront homepage template.

Update: Note that Woocommerce version 4.7.0 and higher does not use the `Homepage` template by default (tested with storefront theme version 2.5.3). Instead the homepage is created with separte shortcode functions, giving the users a better way to manage the homepage.  But this plugin will still work, just make sure that the template used for the home page is `Homepage` template of storefront theme and not any other page template.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with all Woocommerce Themes? =

No. It works only on default Storefront Theme from Woocommerce. 

= I have changed the default home page template of Storefront Theme. Will the plugin work now? =

It may or may not work, depeding on the level of changes you have made. The plugin is supposed to work only on unchanged default home page template of Storefront Theme.
It may work in case you have made only cosmetic changes, like changing colors and fonts, and may stop working if you have added hooks or filters to the theme.
